            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>CNMI In Focus was created to make it easier for travelers to explore the Northern Mariana Islands. Many
                visitors struggle to find reliable, updated, and organized information about where to eat, what to do,
                and how to navigate the islands. Our mission is to bring all of that information together in one clear,
                accessible, and user-friendly website.
            </p>
        <br>
            <h2>The Problem We Aim to Solve</h2>
            <p>
                Information about the CNMI is often scattered across outdated websites, inconsistent travel blogs,
                or social media posts that lack accuracy. Local businesses also struggle with limited online presence,
                making it difficult for them to reach potential customers. Travelers need a trustworthy guide, and
                local businesses need visibility.
            </p>
        <br>
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
                CNMI In Focus provides organized listings of restaurants, hiking trails, cultural sites, and activities
                across Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. Each page includes photos, maps, contact information, and helpful
                insights to make planning easier. The site also highlights local businesses, giving them a platform to reach
                visitors and share what they offer. By combining accurate information with a clean design, CNMI In Focus helps
                both travelers and the local community.
